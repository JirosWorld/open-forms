# Form field

Some authentication plugins offer the option of overriding the Level of Assurance (LoA) per form.
This form field is visible in the additional plugin configuration of the selected plugin, if it
allows LoA overriding. It is then possible to select the new minimum desired LoA for this specific
plugin.
